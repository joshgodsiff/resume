  I'm Josh. Iâ€™m a software developer with around 7 years of commercial experience, and I currently live and work in Sydney.

  For most of 2020 I have been working on my own startup in the digital identity space. However, due to some significant life events I'm putting that on the back-burner for a few years and hopping back into the job market.

  My expertise is in large-scale data processing pipelines and functional programming, and I have extensive experience doing web development. I'm also passionate about privacy, civil liberties, and the environment.

  For my next role I'm looking for something where I can step up and take on more responsibility. In particular, a role where I can work across both software development and product management would be ideal.

  I graduated from the Australian National University in 2014 with a Bachelor of Computer
  Science (Honours) - one of their most challenging and selective degrees.

  At university I focused on large scale parallel and distributed systems; various machine learning, data mining and AI techniques; and a healthy dose of pure theory and mathematics.
