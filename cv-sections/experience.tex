\cventry
{Staff Software Engineer} % Job title
{Voly} % Organization
{Sydney, Australia} % Location
{October 2021 - June 2022} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
  \item {At Voly I worked as a senior - and later staff - software engineer, nominally on the backend team, although in practice my role encompassed the full stack from the web front-end, to the backend, to server administration, cloud infrastructure, databases and security.}
  \item {I was responsible for maintaining and building upon the initial go-to-market MVP software that the company had procured - written in TypeScript using NestJS and GraphQL, and using Shopify as a backend for most of the ecommerce aspects.}
  \item {I was also responsible for facilitating a company wide consultation and requirements gathering process to define the scope of a replacement backend system that was fit for purpose for the company's mid and long term growth and product goals.}
  \item {My team had begun work implementing this new backend, using Haskell, Postgres and Hasura (a Postgres-to-GraphQL API layer), as well as Terraform for managing infrastructure on Google Cloud. Unfortunately, due to the global downturn, my role was impacted by a round of layoffs so we were not able to complete this work.}
  \item {On the softer-skill side, I also had a lot of fun mentoring some junior and mid-level frontend developers, and bringing my team up to speed working in an agile Kanban system.}

\cventry
{Senior Software Engineer} % Job title
{Prezzee} % Organization
{Sydney, Australia} % Location
{March 2021 - September 2021} % Date(s)
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item {At Prezzee, I was responsible for integrating the company's chosen CMS (Kentico Kontent) into their website and their app's web front-end, in order to enable non-technical employees to manage content.}
\item {I was also responsible for creating a large chunk of their web UI component library, and integrating that into the website and app as part of a site redesign that was happening at the same time as the CMS was being rolled out.}
\item {The work was largely done in ReScript and React. There was also integration work involving Next.js, and infrastructure work in Terraform.}
\item {As a part of that work, I helped onboard and upskill several junior and mid-level engineers onto the project, and was in practice running the dev team a lot the time as the lead / head-of-frontend was often busy with other work.}
\item {I also introduced several new agile practices that resulted in my team being one of the most consistent and accurately performing (in terms of estimates vs reality) teams in the company.}

{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities

\item {At Netscout I worked as part of an agile team to deliver scalable data processing pipelines that power a suite of analytics tools and services which are used by both their customers, and their sales and support teams.}
\item {My team and I were responsible for almost all aspects of these pipelines, including development, deployment, monitoring, end-to-end-testing, and working with our product and delivery management team to clarify goals and scope work.}
\item {I primarily worked in Haskell for development, with some forays into Scala (legacy pipelines), Ruby \& Terraform (deployment \& infrastructure tooling), Python (ML code, scripting), and even occasional bits of C and JavaScript.}
\item {I learned an incredible amount, especially about what it takes to develop and deploy stable, scalable, and maintainable solutions. I also greatly enjoyed some of my secondary duties, which included leading internal workshops on Haskell and functional programming, as well as mentoring interns in some fundamental computer-science concepts.}

{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
  \item {At Mediaware I worked in an agile team to deliver mission critical video processing software to our broadcast customers around the globe.}
  \item {My main responsibility was leading the development and design of the web-based user interfaces to our core products. These used a custom Python + KnockoutJS framework, as the products had real-time constraints that required a careful interaction model. I also introduced a more traditional AngularJS + Python stack for a separate project.}
% \item {My other responsibilities included working with senior architects on system design, and liaising with stakeholders to gather requirements and feedback}
%  \item {I also dove into the main server applications (C/C++) from time to time to implement the relevant endpoints and data sources for the UI.}
